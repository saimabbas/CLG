                  <h4>What is Validation?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Debt validation is a legal debt resolution process in which
                    creditors need to prove that you owe the funds that appear
                    in your name. It is a basic right to challenge debt that may
                    have been wrongfully attributed to you.
                    <br />
                    The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) gives every
                    American the right to contest inaccurate debt by writing an
                    appeal to the collector within 30 days of a collection
                    request.
                    <br />
                    The collection request can be by phone or writing, but needs
                    to clearly identify the creditor and amount owed. If the
                    first contact is by phone, the collector must notify you in
                    writing within 5 days. In any case, you should act quickly
                    so you don’t miss your window of opportunity.
