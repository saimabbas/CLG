                <li>
                  The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and
                  therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the
                  price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as
                  specified on the order page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In case the purchased Product requires active input from the
                  User, such as the provision of personal information or data,
                  specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates
                  an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt
                  confirming that the order has been received.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                All notifications related to the described purchasing process
                shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such
                purposes.
              </p>
              <h4>Methods of payment</h4>
              <p>
                Information related to accepted payment methods are made
                available during the purchasing process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional
                conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be
                found in the dedicated section of this Website.
              </p>
              <p>
                All payments are independently processed through third-party
                services. Therefore, this Website does not collect any payment
                information &ndash; such as credit card details &ndash; but only
                receives a notification once the payment has been successfully
                completed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by
                the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no
                obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or
                fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne
                by the User.
              </p>
              <h4>Retention of usage rights</h4>
              <p>
                Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product
                until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.
              </p>
              <h3>Performance of services</h3>
              <p>
                The purchased service shall be performed or made available
                within the timeframe specified on this Website or as
                communicated before the order submission.
              </p>
              <h3>User rights</h3>
              <h4>Right of withdrawal</h4>
              <p>
                Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw
                from the contract within the period specified below (generally
                14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can
                learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.
              </p>
              <h4>Who the right of withdrawal applies to</h4>
              <p>
                Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who
                are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation
                right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into
                online (distance contracts) within the specified period
                applicable to their case, for any reason and without
                justification.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from
                the rights described in this section.
              </p>
              <h4>Exercising the right of withdrawal</h4>
              <p>
                To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the
                Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw
                from the contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available
                from within the &ldquo;definitions&rdquo; section of this
                document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to
                withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in
                any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within
                which they can exercise such right, Users must send the
                withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.
              </p>
              <p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Regarding the purchase of a service, the withdrawal period
                  expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered
                  into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Effects of withdrawal</h4>
              <p>
                Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed
                by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a
                particular delivery method other than the least expensive type
                of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be
                reimbursed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any
                event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is
                informed of the User&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from the
                contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements
                will be made using the same means of payment as used to process
                the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur
                any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.
              </p>
              <h3>&hellip;on the purchase of services</h3>
              <p>
                Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having
                requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal
                period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which
                is in proportion to the part of service provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually
                agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided
                until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full
                coverage of the contract.
              </p>
              <h4>Exceptions from the right of withdrawal</h4>
              <p>The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  for the provision of services, after the service has been
                  fully performed if the performance has begun with the
                  consumer&rsquo;s prior express consent, and with their
                  acknowledgement that their right of withdrawal is lost once
                  the contract has been fully
                </li>
                <li>performed;</li>
              </ul>

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of

                The Owner&rsquo;s failure to assert any right or provision under
                these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or

                Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend
                or terminate the Service altogether. If the Service is
                terminated, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them
                to withdraw Personal Data or information in accordance with
                applicable law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons
                outside the Owner&rsquo;s reasonable control, such as
                &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; (eg. labor actions, infrastructural
                breakdowns or blackouts etc).

              <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
              <p>
                The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these
                Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately
                inform the User of these changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User for
                the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                The continued use of the Service will signify the User&rsquo;s
                acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be
                bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service. Failure
                to accept the revised Terms, may entitle either party to
                terminate the Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The applicable previous version will govern the relationship
                prior to the User&rsquo;s acceptance. The User can obtain any
                previous version from the Owner.
              </p>
              <p>
                If required by applicable law, the Owner will specify the date
                by which the modified Terms will enter into force.
              </p>
              <h3>Assignment of contract</h3>
              <p>
                The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by
                novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under
                these Terms, taking the User&rsquo;s legitimate interests into
                account. Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply
                accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations
                under these Terms in any way, without the written permission of

              </p>
              <h3>Contacts</h3>
              <p>

                sent using the contact information stated in this document.
              </p>
              <h3>Severability</h3>
              <p>
                Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid
                or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or
                unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity
                of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force
                and effect.
              </p>
              <h3>US Users</h3>
              <p>
                Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted,
                construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to
                render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original
                intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between
                Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof,
                and supersede all other communications, including but not
                limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with
                respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to
                the fullest extent permitted by law.
              </p>
              <h3>EU Users</h3>
              <p>
                Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void,
                invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to
                find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable
                provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or
                unenforceable parts.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable
                provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory
                provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the
                impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms
                shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed
                provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance
                that the parties would not have entered into the contract if
                they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in
                cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an
                unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.
              </p>
              <h3>Governing law</h3>
              <p>
                These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner
                is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this document,
                without regard to conflict of laws principles.
              </p>
              <h4>Exception for European Consumers</h4>
              <p>
                However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a
                European Consumer and has their habitual residence in a country
                where the law provides for a higher consumer protection
                standard, such higher standards shall prevail.
              </p>
              <h3>Venue of jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting
                from or connected to these Terms lies with the courts of the
                place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant
                section of this document.
              </p>
              <h4>Exception for European Consumers</h4>
              <p>
                The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European
                Consumers, nor to Consumers based in Switzerland, Norway or
                Iceland.
              </p>
              <h3>Dispute resolution</h3>
              <h4>Amicable dispute resolution</h4>
              <p>
                Users may bring any disputes to the Owner who will try to
                resolve them amicably.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Users&rsquo; right to take legal action shall always
                remain unaffected, in the event of any controversy regarding the
                use of this Website or the Service, Users are kindly asked to
                contact the Owner at the contact details provided in this
                document.
              </p>
              <p>
                The User may submit the complaint including a brief description
                and if applicable, the details of the related order, purchase,
                or account, to the Owner&rsquo;s email address specified in this
                document.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Owner will process the complaint without undue delay and
                within 21 days of receiving it.
              </p>
              <h4>Online dispute resolution for Consumers</h4>
              <p>
                The European Commission has established an online platform for
                alternative dispute resolutions that facilitates an out-of-court
                method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from
                online sale and service contracts.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, any European Consumer can use such platform for
                resolving any dispute stemming from contracts which have been
                entered into online. The platform is&nbsp;<a
