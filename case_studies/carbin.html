                <h2>Corbin’s Story</h2>
                <span>Virginia Beach, VA</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Corbin, a veteran, receives pension as his sole income. He has
                  3 types of debt enrolled in our program, medical bills and
                  credit card debt to pay for his familys’ monthly needs. The
                  client conveyed his hardship to the CLG team during the time
                  of enrollment with court-ordered garnishments, which had been
                  neglected prior to his time at CLG.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

                <h3>CLG’s Work</h3>
                <br />
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The team reached out to the other parties involved: the
                    original creditor and the opposing counsel to clarify that
                    the client owed an outstanding balance. He owed $11,000 and
                    the proposed amount for the garnishment would remove 25% of
                    the client’s paycheck. The national average is 9%.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Our CLG attorneys successfully negotiated and prevented the
                    garnishment on his income. Attorney consistently spoke
                    directly with the client to update them of our efforts as
                    well as seeking necessary information to reach an ideal
                    outcome.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As a result, the clients’ wages were prevented from being
                    garnished. They reached an agreement with the creditor for a
                    manageable payment plan. In addition, the original amount
                    that was owed was reduced to half by the attorneys.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The settlement agreement was happily signed by the client on
                    7/14/23.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We informed the client of the results. The client was
                    overjoyed that the garnishment was fought off and settled
                    for half of the original amount. CLG was pleased to be able
                    to save the client $400 a month especially given his income
                    restrictions. Instead the client will be paying half over an
                    agreed upon span of time. In regards to his other debts
                    enrolled, he trusts the CLG process and attorneys to
                    invalidate them both expediently and successfully.
