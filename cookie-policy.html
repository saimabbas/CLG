              <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
              <p>
                This document informs Users about the technologies that help
                this Website to achieve the purposes described below. Such
                technologies allow the Owner to access and store information
                (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by
                running a script) on a User&rsquo;s device as they interact with
                this Website.
              </p>
              <p>
                For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as
                &ldquo;Trackers&rdquo; within this document &ndash; unless there
                is a reason to differentiate.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile
                browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the
                context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For
                this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used
                where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type
                of Tracker.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also
                require the User&rsquo;s consent. Whenever consent is given, it
                can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions
                provided in this document.
              </p>
              <p>
                This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner
                (so-called &ldquo;first-party&rdquo; Trackers) and Trackers that
                enable services provided by a third-party (so-called
                &ldquo;third-party&rdquo; Trackers). Unless otherwise specified
                within this document, third-party providers may access the
                Trackers managed by them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar
                Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or
                the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of
                the User&rsquo;s browsing session.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to what&rsquo;s specified in the descriptions within
                each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and
                updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as
                any other relevant information &ndash; such as the presence of
                other Trackers &ndash; in the linked privacy policies of the
                respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.

              <p>Basic interactions &amp; functionalities</p>
              <p>
                This Website uses Trackers to enable basic interactions and
                functionalities, allowing Users to access selected features of
                the Service and facilitating the User&rsquo;s communication with
                the Owner.
              </p>

              <h3>How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</h3>
              <p>
                There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and
                to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:
              </p>
              <p>
                Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly
                within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the
                use or storage of Trackers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent,
                Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their
                preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such
                preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences
                widget, if available.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to
                delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to
                remember the User&rsquo;s initial consent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other Trackers in the browser&rsquo;s local memory may be
                cleared by deleting the browsing history.
              </p>
              <p>
                With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their
                preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out
                link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third
                party&rsquo;s privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.

                Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on
                mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such
                as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or
                tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings
                and look for the relevant setting).

                Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the
                advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that Users make use
                of these resources in addition to the information provided in
                this document.
              </p>

              <h4>Consequences of denying consent</h4>
              <p>
                Users are free to decide whether or not to grant consent.
                However, please note that Trackers help this Website to provide
                a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in
                line with the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, in
                the absence of the User&rsquo;s consent, the Owner may be unable
                to provide related features.
