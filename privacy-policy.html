                Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data
                obtained, published or shared through this Website and confirm
                that they have the third party&rsquo;s consent to provide the
                Data to the Owner.
              </p>
              <h3>Mode and place of processing the Data</h3>
              <h4>Methods of processing</h4>
              <p>
                The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
                unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
                destruction of the Data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT
                enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
                strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the
                Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain
                types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this
                Website (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
                administration) or external parties (such as third-party
                technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers,
                IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary,
                as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these
                parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
              </p>
              <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4>
              <p>
                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
                the following applies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                  purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
                  allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                  such processing (&ldquo;opt-out&rdquo;), without having to
                  rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
                  This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                  Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                </li>
                <li>
                  provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                  agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                  obligations thereof;
                </li>
                <li>
                  processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
                  to which the Owner is subject;
                </li>
                <li>
                  processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                  public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                  vested in the Owner;
                </li>
                <li>
                  processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                  interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
                legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
                whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
                into a contract.
              </p>
              <h4>Place</h4>
              <p>
                The Data is processed at the Owner&rsquo;s operating offices and
                in any other places where the parties involved in the processing
                are located.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the User&rsquo;s location, data transfers may
                involve transferring the User&rsquo;s Data to a country other
                than their own. To find out more about the place of processing
                of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing
                details about the processing of Personal Data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
                transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
                international organization governed by public international law
                or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about
                the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their
                Data.
              </p>
              <p>
                If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
                checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with
                the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
              </p>
              <h4>Retention time</h4>
              <p>
                Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
                required by the purpose they have been collected for.
              </p>
              <p>Therefore:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Personal Data collected for purposes related to the
                  performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall
                  be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner&rsquo;s
                  legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
                  fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                  regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within
                  the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                  Owner.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
                period whenever the User has given consent to such processing,
                as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner
                may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period
                whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal
                obligation or upon order of an authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be
                deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure,
                the right to rectification and the right to data portability
                cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
              </p>
              <h3>The purposes of processing</h3>
              <p>
                The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to
                provide its Service, comply with its legal obligations, respond
                to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or
                those of its Users or third parties), detect any malicious or
                fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Remarketing and
                behavioral targeting, Analytics, Contacting the User,
                Advertising, Managing contacts and sending messages, User
                database management, Displaying content from external platforms,
                Infrastructure monitoring, Tag Management and Content
                performance and features testing (A/B testing).
              </p>
              <p>
                For specific information about the Personal Data used for each
                purpose, the User may refer to the section &ldquo;Detailed
                information on the processing of Personal Data&rdquo;
              </p>
              <h3>Information on opting out of interest-based advertising</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to any opt-out feature provided by any of the
                services listed in this document, Users may learn more on how to
                generally opt out of interest-based advertising within the
                dedicated section of the Cookie Policy.
              </p>
              <h3>The rights of Users</h3>
              <p>
                Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed
                by the Owner.
              </p>
              <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Withdraw their consent. Users have the right to withdraw
                  consent where they have previously given their consent to the
                  processing of their Personal Data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to
                  object to the processing of their Data if the processing is
                  carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Further
                  details are provided in the dedicated section below.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is
                  being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding
                  certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the
                  Data undergoing processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify
                  the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or
                  corrected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right,
                  under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of
                  their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their
                  Data for any purpose other than storing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed. Users
                  have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the
                  erasure of their Data from the Owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Receive their Data and have it transferred to another
                  controller. Users have the right to receive their Data in a
                  structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                  technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
                  controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
                  provided that the Data is processed by automated means and
                  that the processing is based on the User&rsquo;s consent, on a
                  contract which the User is part of or on pre-contractual
