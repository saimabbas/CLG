              <h1>Get to Know the Fair Credit Billing Act</h1>
              <h2>What is the FCBA?</h2>
              <p>
                The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) was established to protect
                the average American against common billing errors and unjust
                billing practices associated with specific types of credit.
                American consumers are easily targeted by predatory lending
                practices by big banks and other creditor organizations.
                However, federal statutes like the FCBA provide a fence around
                consumer rights and ultimately a consumerâ€™s creditworthiness.
                <br />
                <br />
                Initially added as an amendment to the 1974 Truth in Lending Act
                (TILA), the FCBA serves as a federal law that clearly outlines
                billing errors and offers guidance to both lenders and consumers
                on how to address them. Additionally, the law provides a
                protective shield for consumers in case of disputes.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                Here are the key takeaways about the protective measures for
                consumers set forth by the FCBA:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) is an extension of the
                  Truth in Lending Act (TILA) designed to safeguard consumers
                  from unfair billing practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The FCBA offers protection to consumers who hold open-end
                  credit accounts, such as credit cards, by granting them the
                  right to challenge any billing errors they encounter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the consumer's dispute is found valid, their bill will be
                  adjusted accordingly, which may involve issuing a credit for
                  the disputed charge or a partial amount of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The consumer as well as the original creditor have
                  responsibilities under the FCBA to document and acknowledge
                  any dispute letters in a timely fashion.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                What types of billing errors does the FCBA protect consumers
                against?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The FCBA provides protection against billing errors that occur
                on open-ended or revolving accounts, including credit cards,
                charge cards, and home equity lines of credit (HELOC). However,
                it does not extend to debit transactions or installment loans,
                such as auto loans, which have a fixed repayment period.
                Different laws offer consumer protections for those specific
                types of transactions.
              </p>

              <br />
              <br />
              <p>Examples of billing errors covered by the FCBA:</p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unauthorized charges appearing on a consumer's monthly billing
                  statement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inaccurate reflection of the date or amount of a transaction
                  on the billing statement.
                </li>
                <li>Accounting mistakes made by the creditor.</li>
                <li>
                  Failure to send a required billing statement to the borrower
                  or not meeting other related requirements.
                </li>
                <li>Charges for items that were purchased but not received.</li>
                <li>
                  Charges for goods or services that the borrower rejected or
                  were not delivered as promised.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Absence of a statement credit for returned merchandise or
                  failure to credit a payment made by the borrower.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                Notably, the FCBA does not address complaints about the quality
                of goods or services received from a merchant. Moreover,
                disputing a billing error under the FCBA differs from requesting
                a refund due to disagreements about policies, services, or
                canceled plans.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our attorneys here at CLG diligently utilize laws like the FCBA
                within the TILA to find how creditors often violate simple and
                basic consumer rights to gain the most amount of money from
                their clients. However, we are committed to finding the best
                legal course of action to uphold your consumer rights and fight
                on your behalf against unfair practices.

                Creditors Beware: The Law That Protects You From Abusive Debt
                Collection Practices
              </h1>
              <h2>What is the FDCPA?</h2>
              <p>
                The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) was established
                to provide legal protection to the average American consumer
                from abusive debt collection practices. The FDCPA is a federal
                law that limits the actions of third-party debt collectors who
                are attempting to collect debts on behalf of another party or
                entity (the original creditor).
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                The FDCPA became effective in March of 1978, and was designed to
                eliminate abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection
                practices.
              </p>

              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                Here are the key takeaways about the guidelines set forth by the
                FDCPA:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) covers when,
                  how, and which ways a debt collector can contact a
                  debtor/consumer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The FDCPA provides structure that debt collectors can not
                  contact any other party other than the debtor, in certain
                  ways. The FDCPA also ensures that the debt collectors can not
                  harass, threaten, or use any profanity when making an attempt
                  to collect a debt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the debtor feels as though they are being harassed, or that
                  any of their FDCPA laws are being violated, then the debtor
                  can sue the third-party/debt collector for statutory damages
                  for up to $1,000 per violation.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                What types of harassment does the FDCPA protect debtors against?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The FDCPA provides protection against harassment from
                third-party debt collectors. The FDCPA states that a third-party
                debt collector can not contact a debtor outside of certain time
                periods, as well as limiting the amount of calls in a day a
                debtor can receive. The FDCPA states that a third-party debt
                collector can not threaten or imply any legal action against the
                debtor without true intent behind it. The FDCPA also states that
                the third-party debt collector, can not contact any family
                members or friends to obtain information about the debtor, other
                than confirming an address of residency.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>Examples of harassment covered by the FDCPA:</p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>Receiving phone calls before 8 am or after 9 pm.</li>
                <li>Receiving 7 calls within 7 consecutive days.</li>
                <li>
                  The use of any profanity from the third-party debt collector
                  towards the debtor when attempting to collect a debt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contacting friends and family informing them of the debtor's
                  status with the debt, as well as asking for information on the
                  debtor other than the address of residency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Threatening legal action on the debtor, with no real intent,
                  such as lawsuits or claiming legal enforcement on the debtor,
                  such as an arrest to occur.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a third-party debt collector fails to disclose they are a
                  debt collector while attempting to collect a debt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a third-party debt collector insinuates that they work for
                  the credit bureaus or any government agency.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                It's important to note that the FDCPA does not address
                harassment when it comes to the original creditor unless in the
                states of California or Florida. Moreover, the FDCPA is in place
                to hold third-party debt collectors accountable for harassment
                when it comes to collecting a debt they originally had no
                authority over. In the past years, third-party collectors have
                become more and more aggressive towards the debtors in the
                attempt to collect debts, and the federal government is working
                towards protecting debtors everyday.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the FDCPA matter for CLG clients?</h3>
              <p>
                Our attorneys here at CLG diligently utilize laws like the FDCPA
                to find out how third-party debt collectors are violating the
                laws when it comes to debtor rights. Our attorneys build cases
                against the third-party debt collectors, with the hopes of
                discovering enough violations that the damages received
                potentially cover the entire debt owed, as well as simply
                rewarding the client money from these parties. We are committed
                to finding the best legal course of action to uphold your debtor
                rights and fight on your behalf against unfair practices.
